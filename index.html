The SME-SCD50 to be ordered with SDM-SC100 which is a light plastic shoe caver. A heavier slip resistant version of the shoe is available, SDM-SCNW30. These covers are absolutely ideal for moderate use in reasonably dry indoor environments. There are practical limitations. The shoes are not designed for repeated heavy duty work, or for use on rugged or very abrasive surfaces, or where there is very smooth and wet slippery flooring. Shoes and boots should be dry before the covers are fitted. The SME-SCD50 units should not be located in cold stores, because prolonged cold reduces the elasticity and effectiveness of the SDM-SC100/SDM-SCNW30 ankle band. Covers fit up to size UK 13 / EU 2/1 48.</p>
